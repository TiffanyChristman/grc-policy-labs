# Vendor Risk Assessment & Due Diligence (GRC Lab)

This project demonstrates a **Vendor Risk Assessment** for a fictional third‑party service provider. It reflects core *Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)* techniques for evaluating vendor security posture, data handling practices, and compliance with industry frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2).
