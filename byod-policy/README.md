# BYOD & VPN Security Policy (GRC Lab)

This project is a simulated **GRC policy development lab** focused on securing **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** usage and remote access through **VPN** in a healthcare environment. The policy is designed to meet regulatory requirements such as **HIPAA** while supporting productivity and data protection for remote and mobile staff.
